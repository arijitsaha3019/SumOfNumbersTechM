The following java program utilizes REST GET to fetch JSON documents and operate on individual JSON arrays to get the total sum of the array "numbers" of individual array and also the total sum of all the numbers. It also displays the total number
of integers the sum operated on.

It utilizes POSTMAN to create a mock server using JSON documents and it can be found in data.json file.
The Mockserver can be tested using collection GetNumbers.postman_collection.json also uploaded in the repository.

The url of the mock server is stored in a properties file named config.properties and the program utilizes the file
to get url.
